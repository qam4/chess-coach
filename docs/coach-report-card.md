# Coach report card — progression log

The **coach report card** is a single-mode holistic review (not an A/B): it
plays one real game, coaches every student move with the shipping config while
timing each generation, appends curated endgame/tactic positions for phase
coverage, then a frontier reviewer (claude-sonnet-4.6 via kiro-cli) returns one
verdict — a **0–10 score against the VISION "bridge" standard** plus honest
critique and phase-fit. It answers "is the coach the teacher we envisioned?".

- Tooling: `scripts/eval_coach_review.py` (driver) + `src/chess_coach/eval/coach_review.py` (pure core).
- Run: `--seed 7` fixes the game so successive runs are a clean before/after.
- Artifacts live under `output/` (gitignored); results are recorded here.

## Two signals, different trust levels

- **Deterministic fidelity counts** (off_menu / unsound_move / placement) —
  trustworthy, no noise.
- **The 0–10 judge score** — good for *direction* but **noisy at n=1**; small
  deltas (±0.3–0.7) are within noise. Its real value is the **qualitative
  diagnosis**, which has been stable across runs. Do not over-read a single
  score delta; corroborate with the deterministic counts and repeated themes.

All runs below: qwen3:14b coach, sonnet judge, seed 7, 44 coached turns
(10 opening / 16 middlegame / 18 endgame; 23 good / 9 inaccuracy / 8 mistake /
4 blunder).

## Progression

| # | change | judge score | off_menu | unsound | placement | kept? |
|---|--------|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------:|:---------:|:-----:|
| baseline | shipping config (guidance on) | 3.5 | 8 | 4 | 1 | — |
| lever 1 | remove always-on opening "CHESS PRINCIPLES" crib from `SYSTEM_PROMPT_V2` | 4.2 | 8 | 5 | 1 | **yes** |
| lever 2 | add grounding rule: don't invent causal chains ("allows/supports/weakens") | 4.5 | 9 | 4 | 1 | **reverted** |
| lever 3 | severity-tiered response (tone + length by eval-drop band; no filler sign-offs) | 4.5 | **4** | **2** | 2 | **yes** |

**Lever 1 (kept).** The static crib was injected on every turn and drove
recycled generic advice ("develop your pieces / is my king safe?") even in the
endgame. Removing it lifted the holistic score (+0.7, directional) with **zero
change to deterministic fidelity** and no regression; low-risk (the pedagogy
guidance layer still supplies a principle). Kept.

**Lever 2 (reverted).** A bare "don't invent cause-and-effect" grounding rule
did **not** measurably reduce fabrication — off_menu 8→9, unsound 5→4 (flat),
and the judge still cited hallucinated justifications. +0.3 is within noise.
No demonstrable benefit, so it was reverted to keep the prompt lean (a negative
result is a valid finding: qwen3:14b doesn't reliably follow a negative
constraint on causal reasoning the way it followed the concrete "no `and
then...` continuations" rule).

**Lever 3 (kept).** Severity-tiered move feedback — the response's directness
and length scale with the eval-drop band (best/sound → short affirmation;
inaccuracy → brief redirect; serious → direct "lead with the cost", no
cushioning), keyed on OUR own bands (`SOUND_MAX_DROP_CP`/`DUBIOUS_MAX_DROP_CP`),
never the engine's label (BUG-016). Score flat (+0.3, within noise) but the
**trustworthy signal moved: off_menu + unsound roughly halved (13 → 6)** — the
tighter, tiered responses give the model fewer openings to ramble into off-menu
/ fabricated recommendations — and the judge now lists calibrated severity as a
*strength*. Kept (measurable deterministic benefit, no regression), unlike
lever 2. What it did NOT fix: the model under-delivers on the *length/depth*
part from prompt text alone — still ~3-5 sentences on best moves, still opens
with "Great job!", still platitudes on blunders. The judge's new #1: enforce
depth differentiation by quality + phase (blunders longest/most specific;
top-moves one sentence) and give opening moves a *named opening concept*. Two
future levers: (a) enforce length/depth (prompt text isn't enough — likely
per-tier generation limits); (b) opening-specific content.

## Stable qualitative findings (across all three runs — the real signal)

1. **Generic recycled principle.** A small rotating set of platitudes
   ("develop knights and bishops", "king safety", "improve your pawn
   structure") repeats regardless of position — one generic lecture
   masquerading as 44 lessons. Lever 1 helped but did not eliminate it.
2. **Flat severity + uniform verbosity.** Blunders and best moves get the same
   warm opener ("Great job / It sounds like you were aiming to…") and the same
   4–6 sentences. A −878cp blunder feels identical to a 0cp best move. The
   judge promoted this to its **#1 highest-leverage change** by run 3: a
   *severity-tiered response protocol* (blunder → direct "this was a serious
   mistake, here's why it loses" + fix; good move → one short affirmation + one
   idea; inaccuracy → brief redirect).
3. **Fabricated / off-menu causal claims.** ~13 deterministic off_menu/unsound
   per run, plus invented mechanisms ("Bc4 allows …capture on d4", "a3 supports
   d4"). Stable; not fixed by lever 2's prompt rule. Likely needs a stronger
   mechanism than a negative instruction (e.g. constraining named moves to the
   menu / a repair pass) — revisit after severity tiering.

## Next: lever 3

**Severity-tiered response protocol** — the judge's consistent #1. Differentiate
the response by the engine's move classification: blunder/mistake → direct,
specific correction with the concrete consequence; good/best → one short
affirmation + one forward idea; inaccuracy → brief redirect. This attacks the
flat-severity + verbosity themes directly and forces specificity on the moves
that matter most. Measured with the report card (seed 7) before/after.
