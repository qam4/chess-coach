# Chess Coach — Known Issues

Tracked issues discovered during development and testing.

## Engine Issues

### BUG-001: Engine only reaches depth 9 despite requesting depth 18
- **Observed**: Analysis of starting position with `depth=18` returns
  `depth=9` after ~90s, then times out.
- **Impact**: Shallow analysis produces weak evaluations. Engine thinks
  `e3` is best in the starting position (should be `e4` or `d4`).
- **Root cause**: Unknown. Possibly the `analyze` command timeout
  (`max(60.0, depth * 5.0)` = 90s) is too short for Blunder to reach
  depth 18, or the engine stalls at higher depths.
- **Debug data**: `"lines": [{"depth": 9, "score_cp": 96, "pv": ["e3", ...]}]`

### BUG-002: Engine analysis returns empty lines for some positions
- **Observed**: `analyze_position` for
  `rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1`
  returns `"lines": []` after 90s.
- **Impact**: LLM gets an empty "Engine analysis:" section and
  hallucinates. Coaching text is fabricated with no grounding.
- **Root cause**: Engine may not be producing parseable output for
  this position, or the thinking line parser is failing silently.
  Need to capture raw engine stdout to diagnose.

### BUG-003: Engine plays Na6 (b8a6) — a terrible move
- **Observed**: `engine.play()` returns `b8a6` (Na6) as Black's
  response to 1.d4 and 1.e4. Na6 is a rim knight move that violates
  basic opening principles.
- **Impact**: Games against the engine are not realistic or useful
  for coaching.
- **Root cause**: Likely related to BUG-001/BUG-002. If the engine
  can't analyze properly, `play()` (which uses `sd 18` + `go`) may
  also be producing garbage. The 1s response time for depth 18 is
  suspiciously fast.

### BUG-004: eval_after always returns 0cp
- **Observed**: After any user move, `raw_eval_after_cp` is 0,
  making every opening move look like a 96cp inaccuracy.
- **Impact**: Move classification is broken. `d4` and `e4` are
  classified as "inaccuracy" when they're among the best moves.
- **Root cause**: Related to BUG-002. The post-move analysis returns
  no lines, so `score_cp` defaults to 0. The eval comparison
  `eval_before(96) - eval_after(0) = 96cp drop` triggers the
  inaccuracy threshold (>30cp).

## LLM Issues

### BUG-005: LLM hallucinates when engine data is missing
- **Observed**: When engine analysis is empty, the LLM fabricates
  analysis. Examples:
  - Claims Na6 "attacks the pawn on e4" (it doesn't)
  - Says Na6 is on a "central square" (a6 is the rim)
  - Describes "pawns on d4 and d5" in the starting position
- **Impact**: Coaching text is misleading and teaches wrong concepts.
- **Root cause**: The prompt doesn't instruct the LLM to refuse when
  data is missing. The LLM fills gaps with plausible-sounding but
  incorrect chess analysis.
- **Fix**: Add guardrails to the prompt: "If engine analysis is empty
  or incomplete, say so. Do not invent analysis."
- **Status**: FIXED — guardrails added to SYSTEM_PROMPT in prompts.py

## Performance Issues

### BUG-006: Play mode takes 6-8 minutes per move
- **Observed**: Full pipeline per move:
  - `evaluate_move`: ~290s (2 engine analyses + 1 LLM call)
  - `engine.play`: ~1s
  - `explain_engine_move`: ~100s (1 engine analysis + 1 LLM call)
  - `final_analysis`: ~90s (1 engine analysis)
  - Total: ~480s (8 minutes)
- **Impact**: Unusable for interactive play.
- **Breakdown**: 4 engine analyses × ~90s + 2 LLM calls × ~15-100s
- **Potential fixes**:
  - Lower depth for play mode (depth 12 or less)
  - Reuse the pre-move analysis from `evaluate_move` in
    `explain_engine_move` (currently re-analyzes the same position)
  - Skip `final_analysis` (redundant — we already have eval)
  - Batch the two LLM calls into one prompt
- **Status**: PARTIALLY FIXED — eliminated 2 redundant engine analyses
  per move (reuse eval_after analysis in explain_engine_move, skip
  final_analysis). Pipeline now does 2 engine analyses + 1 engine play
  + 2 LLM calls instead of 4 analyses + 1 play + 2 LLM calls.
  Estimated savings: ~180s per move (2 × ~90s engine analysis).
